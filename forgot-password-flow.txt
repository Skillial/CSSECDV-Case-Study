Forgot Password Flow

Step 1: Initiate Password Reset
Step 2: User Provides Verification Details
User Action: On the "Forgot Password" form, the user inputs their username, selects their security question from a pre-defined list, and types in their answer to that question. They then submit the form.

If no user is found for the given username, the system immediately flashes a generic error message: "Could not verify your details. Please try again." and redirects back to the forgot-password page. It does not tell the user that the username was incorrect.

Security Question & Answer Verification:

Step 3: Password Reset (If Verification is Successful)
User Action: If the username, security question, and security answer are all successfully verified by the backend (meaning isQuestionMatch and isAnswerMatch are both true), the user is redirected to the "Reset Password" page.
